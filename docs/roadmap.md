# MediaFlow Slice Roadmap

This file records only large business-capability Slices, their order, dependencies and current
status. Detailed Task, Fix, SHA, test and review history belongs to Git; the pre-migration Roadmap is
preserved as [legacy read-only history](history/roadmap-legacy-2026-08-29.md). Lifecycle rules live
only in [the development workflow](development-workflow.md).

| Slice | Goal | Status | Depends On |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22.3 — Local Storage + Library configuration | Complete the guided Local Storage, ResourceLibrary and MediaLibrary managed-configuration journey | PASS / CLOSED | Managed configuration authority |
| 22.4 — Recognition configuration | Complete managed recognition editing, Strategy Test, explanation and activation | PASS / CLOSED | 22.3 |
| 22.5 — Metadata configuration and correction | Complete managed MetadataPolicy testing, candidate decision, correction and bounded DryRun continuation | PASS / CLOSED | 22.4 |
| 22.6 — Naming / Classification / Organize configuration | Complete managed policy editing, exact-revision preview, Local destination precheck and checked activation | PASS / CLOSED | 22.5 |
| 23 — Stage-aware per-item recovery | Provide checkpoint-aware single and bounded batch recovery without replaying successful siblings or uncertain mutation | PASS / CLOSED | 22.6 closure |
| 24 — Files / Media detail and manual organize | Complete the operator journey from explanation and review to safe manual Preview/Organize and recovery | PASS / CLOSED | 23 |
| 25 — Scheduled automation and unattended organization | Complete operator-configured scheduled scanning and unattended organization using RecognitionType-selected policies under explicit bounded execution authority, plus the production-loop hardening required by that journey | PASS / CLOSED | 24 |

## Current boundary

Slice 25 is PASS / CLOSED at Base `2cee7cc756b90618f14d5d7b112f974fb445a580` and reviewed
Implementation Head `d4da92879b99f1c44ddd717fba1a26e4b0a73493`. It delivered the operator-managed
Automation Task Definition journey from exact-scope validation and zero-mutation Preview through
idempotent scheduled occurrence emission, persistent revocable unattended authority, existing-pipeline
execution and per-item Result/recovery. It does not claim Provider switching, scheduled cache/log
cleanup, remote guided setup or automatic replay of uncertain mutation.

## Roadmap rules

- A alone creates or materially changes large Slice boundaries and ordering.
- B plans Tasks only after a Slice becomes ACTIVE; Roadmap never pre-splits future Slices into Tasks.
- Task PASS, fixes, test counts, probes, rejected SHAs and review narratives never enter this file.
- Safety, product and architecture requirements remain authoritative even when omitted from this
  compact prioritization view.
